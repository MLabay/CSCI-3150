    <p>I enjoy <strong>reading Fantasy</strong>. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068705-the-poppy-war" target="_blank">The Poppy War</a> was so fun to read since it includes a lot of 
    Chinese history and mythology. It's super engaging and the writing is definitely better than a large amount of other fantasy books out there. I'm excited for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Dragon-Republic-R-F-Kuang-audiobook/dp/B07SSCLDVF/ref=sr_1_1?crid=39CHKSHUQAUGJ&keywords=republic+of+dragons&qid=1656032102&s=books&sprefix=republic+of+dragon%2Cstripbooks%2C151&sr=1-1" target="_blank">next one</a>.</p>
